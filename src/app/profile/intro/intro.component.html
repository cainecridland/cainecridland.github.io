        My name is Caine. I'm a software engineer based in London with a passion for programming and a love of engineering solutions to problems, whatever form they may take.
        I consider myself to be a dedicated computer scientist that is eager to learn and enjoys seeing projects from concept through to testing and deployment.

        My degree curriculum consisted of modules including (but not limited to) Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Systems Analysis, Systems Engineering, Networking, Sound & Image Manipulation and Graphics.
        This wide range of topics granted me an excellent introduction to the field.
        My past several years of working as a software engineer have compounded that experience with profound insight into programming in a professional context, allowing me to gain hands-on experience of industry standard best-practices, cutting edge technologies and a greater understanding of the field.

        Currently? I'm in the process of upskilling my front-end development abilities, with a view to transition into full-stack development.
